# Overview of analysis
## purpose:

Our project aims to create a story to convince our investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We have created a set of visualizations to show the length of time bikes are checked out and the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. And also show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results:

In this Visualization, both top start locations and top end locations are the same. This helps us manage inventory if there is an excess or shortage of bikes at particular locations.

In this Visualization, peak riding hours are between 6 am to 10 am and 5 pm to 8 pm on weekdays. On weekends peak riding hours are between 5 am to 10 pm. In terms of gender, males are high bike riders during peak hours.

In this Visualization, most of the riders' checkout time is less than an hour; this pattern follows regardless of age.

# Summary:

This analysis has given a broader perspective of the utilization of bicycles in the NYC Citibike bike sharing program. We can analyze utilization rates based on time of day and location, time and gender, user type, and gender for each day of the week.

## Two additional visualizations:


1. Another visualization would be to determine the bikes due for repair. The bikes used frequently will be in the urge of maintenance, so we can plan for maintenance by selecting the highest number of rides.
2. for this project, we have analyzed only august data; I would like to perform an analysis on other months so that we will have a big picture of how the bike sharing business is doing year along.
